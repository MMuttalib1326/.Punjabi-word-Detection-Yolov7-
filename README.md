In order to train our custom model, we need to assemble a dataset of representative images with bounding box annotations around the objects that we want to detect. And we need our dataset to be in YOLOv7 format.

In Roboflow, We can choose between two paths:

* Convert an existing Coco dataset to YOLOv7 format. In Roboflow it supports over [30 formats object detection formats](https://roboflow.com/formats) for conversion.
* Uploading only these raw images and annotate them in Roboflow with [Roboflow Annotate](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate).


# Version v1 Punjabi Dataset Aug 14, 2022 Looks like this.
